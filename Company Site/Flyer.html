    <ol>
        <li> <h2>Minimalist business flyer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Design principle: Less is more. This approach focuses on a single image and minimal, clean text, using ample white space (or negative space) around the design elements to create a polished and uncluttered look.</li>
                <li>Key features: Strong visual hierarchy, where the most important information is emphasized, often through large, bold fonts.</li>
                <li>Example: A flyer featuring a single, high-quality photograph of a product, surrounded by plenty of white space, with the product name in a bold font and a short description, according to Canva. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
       
        <li> <h2> Visually appealing flyer with strong imagery</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Design principle: Using high-quality images and graphics to grab attention.</li>
                <li>Key features: Features a compelling image (or illustration) relevant to the business and its message. The image can be a backdrop with text layered on top using transparencies and gradients, or a focal point surrounded by complementary design elements.</li>
                <li>Example: A flyer promoting a restaurant with an appetizing image of their signature dish, accompanied by a clear, engaging headline and essential details like location and contact information.  </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><h2> Informative flyer with clear organization</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Design principle: Presenting information clearly and concisely, prioritizing ease of reading.</li>
                <li>Key features: Uses a structured layout (like a grid) or sections to organize information and break up text. Bullet points or infographics can highlight key benefits and details. Includes a prominent call to action and essential contact information.</li>
                <li>Example: A flyer detailing different service packages or product features, using icons to represent each offering and bullet points to list the benefits, according to Venngage.  </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>  <h2>Modern and engaging flyer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Design principle: Incorporating current design trends and a vibrant aesthetic to attract attention.</li>
                <li>Key features: Utilizes bold colors, interesting design elements (shapes, typography with emphasis), and potentially playful or energetic graphics. Focuses on creating a positive mood and making the flyer engaging.</li>
                <li>Example: A flyer for a creative agency using bright, complementary colors, unique typography, and a modern layout that incorporates abstract shapes or graphics. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
